# mnemonics
A mnemonic script for helping you memorize numbers

I've always been interested in being able to memorize numbers (phone numbers, zip codes, stats of sorts) and a long time ago I<br>
figured out how to memorize a lot of numbers by using things I already knew (Valentino Rossi's race #46, Roger Maris' <br>
61 HR record in 1961, Sega Genesis is 16 bit, etc...). I didn't realize I was using mnemonics.  <br>

This script was sketched up to test and sometimes remove/replace such mnemonics.  It is inspired from Ron Ludism's piece in<br>
"Mind Performance Hacks" (hacks #6, 7 and 8) [Mind Performance Hacks by Ron Hale-Evans, 2006 O'Reilly Media, Inc]<br>

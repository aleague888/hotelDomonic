# mnemonics
A mnemonic script for helping you memorize numbers

<p>I've always been interested in being able to memorize numbers (phone numbers, zip codes, stats of sorts) and a long time ago I
figured out how to memorize a lot of numbers by using things I already knew (Valentino Rossi's race #46, Roger Maris' 
61 HR record in 1961, Sega Genesis is 16 bit, etc...). I didn't realize I was using mnemonics. </p>

<p>This script was sketched up to test and sometimes remove/replace such mnemonics.  It is inspired from Ron Ludism's piece in
"Mind Performance Hacks" (hacks #6, 7 and 8) [Mind Performance Hacks by Ron Hale-Evans, 2006 O'Reilly Media, Inc]</p>

<h2>To start -</h2>
<p>Let's just get this going so you can see it in action, then you can tailor it to yourself.</p>
<p>Let's assign a letter to a single digit number:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
    Digit
    </td>
    <td>
    Letter
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      1
    </td>
    <td>
      A
    </td>
  </tr>
  </table>
